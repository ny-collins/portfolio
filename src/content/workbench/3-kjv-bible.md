keyInsights: [
  "This was a 'learning testbed.' I successfully taught myself an entire new framework (Svelte) and a new deployment platform (Cloudflare Pages) from scratch.",
  "Learned the power of resourcefulness. Instead of parsing a PDF, I found a clean JSON data source, which made development 10x faster.",
  "Implemented dynamic routing in SvelteKit to load chapters on demand/[chapterNum]/+page.js`], keeping the app lightweight.",
  "Discovered this is the perfect candidate for an offline-first PWA, as the text is static and should be accessible anywhere."
