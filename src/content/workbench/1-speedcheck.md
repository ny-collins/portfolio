techStack: ["Node.js", "Express", "Vanilla JS", "PWA", "Prometheus", "Jest"]
purpose: "A web-based speed test that measures real-world internet performance across international connections, providing more accurate metrics than local ISP tests for global services."
keyOutcomes: [
  "Built a production-ready backend with full observability stack (Pino logging, Prometheus metrics, circuit breaker pattern)",
  "Implemented PWA with automated cache-busting for offline functionality",
  "Discovered that international speed testing reveals more realistic performance metrics for global cloud services",
  "Created educational content explaining the difference between local vs. global speed measurements"
